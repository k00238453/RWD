        <tr><p>The Mortal Instruments is no doubt one of the best series that I have ever read. I have read all six books in the series, from City of Bones to City of Heavenly Fire. I love everything about the series; it’s one of those books that you don’t ever want to put down and makes you want to finish one more chapter before you turn out the lights. These are the kind of books that make you excited to read.</p>

       <p>Cassandra Clare first got the idea of The Mortal Instruments when her friend was talking about the history of tattoos. Her idea stemmed from myths that tattoos bring power to the person who is marked. In the book, there are runes/tattoos which determine what power a half-angel and half-human will receive to protect the world against demons.</p>

        <p>When I had first heard that The City of Bones, the first book in the series, was being made into a movie, it was all I could talk about. I think at one point my dad got annoyed because I was talking about it so much. I was waiting to see my fantasy put on the big screen and see if the ideas I had in my head would become a reality. Having every paragraph memorized I couldn’t wait to see it put on film. The day the movie was finally released, I had told my dad that we HAD to see it! I NEEDED to see it. When we had sat in our seats I had the biggest grin on my face, smiling from ear to ear.</p>

        <p>As the movie began, that smile slowly faded. It was not how I imagined it to be. It had let me down. All the actors were great such as Lily Collins (daughter of Phil Collins, thanks dad!), Jamie Campbell Bower, Robert Sheehan, and Kevin Zegers. They played the characters well gave the sarcasm and attitude that I had read in the book, but some deliveries in the lines were not what I had imagined.  The story line moved a little too fast for my liking, everything happened at a nice pace in the book. Unfortunately, the director had speed up the plot. On behalf of all Mortal Instrument fans, we were all quiet disappointed with the outcome of the movie. If I were the director of The City of Bones, it would have been a whole lot different than what that director had put on the screen seen by millions.</p>

        <p>I mean don’t get me wrong, I still love the series that got me to finally enjoy reading. But my hopes for how the movie would be, were every different than what I had paid $12.00 to see. I still want the second book in the series, The City of Ashes to become a movie, but I think all staff members working on that film should read the books a few times before they decide to cut out parts that many fans love. It was a mistake when the director cut out the true way all of the characters meet; they even changed Clary from killing a demon to Jace making Clary’s powerful, strong character into a damsel in distress.  I even read that when the directors found out the reaction of Mortal Instruments fans, they are analyzing what they did wrong so they don’t make that mistake with the second film. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy watching The City of Bones, I just think that they could have done it better.</p>

        <p>If they make another mistake like that, I think I might just stick to the books and let my imagination make the movie that I wanted to see.</p>
