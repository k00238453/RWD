            <td><p>When I think back about what bugged me most about the Harry Potter movies, it wasn’t necessarily just that they “left something out” that was in the books. It’s that each book was adapted individually, with not enough care in mind for the endgame. It might seem OK to leave out information about Neville’s parents in Order of the Phoenix if you’re only focusing on the story of that book … but then how is it supposed to be satisfying when he kills Nagini in Deathly Hallows? The adaptation should be able to stand on its own, not as supplemental material. I know that some people love Prisoner of Azkaban the most because it’s so different and artsy or whatever, but it always made me feel like they weren’t concerned about maintaining any kind of aesthetic or logistical continuity.</p>

            <p>Sure, not all of the Harry Potter books were published at the time, and His Dark Materials is completed—but Jo Rowling is a master of planning (she probably plans too much) and told the filmmakers and actors some things. Why not more? How come only Alan Rickman got to know his character’s secret motivation? That they didn’t use her as a resource will bug me until the day I die … or, at least, until the day the Harry Potter series is remade for television.</p>


            <p>Back to His Dark Materials, I’ve seen some complaints that the series so far is rushed, but I think changing up the pacing and structure of the storytelling is OK. Every medium has a different structure by nature. Plays and musicals typically have two acts and one intermission. Movies are written with three acts in mind, your real basic “beginning, middle, and end” arc. Most hour-long drama episodes have five acts with three commercial breaks, and even though HBO doesn’t do commercial breaks, shows like His Dark Materials still adhere relatively to that structure.</p>

            <p>Back to the significance of Andrew Scott, if you’re not familiar with the books, lemme ‘splain. His character is the father of Will Parry, the co-protagonist of The Subtle Knife, who joins Lyra on her journey. She’s still the hero and the chosen one, though; don’t worry. Will is significant enough to the final book that it’s really smart that we’re hearing about him and his dad now. The book kind of abandons Lyra to introduce Will, which is fine when you’re reading but might be disorienting onscreen. He also has a cat.</p>

            <p>These adaptations are good, and not just because the filmmakers are capturing the “spirit” of the source material; they’re actually telling a story that stands on its own. Nobody has ever said that film and television are definitive and that getting adapted should be the “goal” of any book, anyway … your imagination and reading experience isn’t going anywhere. With more adaptations like His Dark Materials, though, maybe we can settle on “the book was different” instead.</p>
