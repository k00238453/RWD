        <tr><p>The Studio Tour begins with a video introduction from Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint (which surprised me, but then I remembered they shot this before they started trying to distance themselves from Harry Potter). The screen goes up into the ceiling and suddenly the Great Hall’s huge entry doors are in front of you. A fan or two receive the honors of opening them, and then you’re in one of Hogwarts’ most iconic areas.</p>

        <p>It’s a thrill to walk into the Great Hall at the beginning of the tour, and what makes this attraction so special is the endless photo opportunities. Once you’re in the Great Hall, you can take photos through 100% of the Studio Tour, opening up lots of great Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebooking moments (pretend you’re eating in the Great Hall, boarding the Hogwarts Express, or visiting the Dursleys at Privet Drive, for example).</p>

        <p>We spent about two hours browsing the various exhibits, but workers say people on average spend three to three and a half. Someone spent as long as 13 hours absorbing everything, according to one employee.</p>

        <p>Costumes, props, creatures, fake bodies, sets, broom rides, wand lessons, and so much more are available to you throughout the tour. It is by far one of the best Harry Potter attractions in the world. Whether you’re a Harry Potter fan or not, you can’t help but appreciate the lessons on what it takes to make a movie.</p>

        <p>I was struck by a thought at the end of my visit: Is this just as good as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme parks in Orlando, Hollywood, and Japan? Like Universal’s themed lands, the Studio Tour has butterbeer*, butterbeer ice cream, and much of the merchandise you can purchase at the theme parks, plus authentic sets, the damn Hogwarts Express (the real one — not the fake one pulled by a wire at Universal Orlando), and all the props, costumes, and costume art.</p>

        <p>Sure, the big difference is that The Wizarding World themed lands have a couple of rides. So? When people cry at Universal’s parks, they’re crying as they walk into Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade for the first time. This is what you’re doing at the Studio Tour. You’re walking into the Great Hall, inside the real Hogwarts Express, through Diagon Alley, through #4 Privet Drive, riding the Knight Bus, and seeing so much more.</p>

        <p>As you probably have seen by now, the tour ends with one of its most remarkable features: A huge model of Hogwarts. The morning we visited the castle, it was being touched up by painters, which was a little surprising. Can’t they do that at night?</p>

        <p>Other benefits over the theme parks: the Studio Tour is a lot cheaper. And parking is free. And there are far shorter lines.</p>

        <p>So, dear Europeans, the next time you grow bothered by the home of Harry Potter lacking a theme park, remind yourselves: You have an attraction that, in many ways, is better than what Universal has conjured.</p>
